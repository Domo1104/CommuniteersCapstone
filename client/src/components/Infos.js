        What is volunteering and how do I choose what to volunteer for?
      </h1>
      <p className="intro">
        Volunteering means: a person who voluntarily undertakes or expresses a
        willingness to undertake a service. First you have to think about what
        type of work you want to do. Do you love animals? Do you want to save
        the environment? Do you want to help people in need? Once you figure out
        your passion you can sign up for different events to help out. One thing
        to keep in mind is that no matter how small or big your contributions
        are you are making a difference.
      </p>

      <p className="body">
        There are a lot of different categories when it comes to volunteering.
        Some of the more common ones include:
        <ul>
          <li>Agriculture</li>
          <li>Children and Youth</li>
          <li>Community Development</li>
          <li>Disaster Relief</li>
          <li>Education</li>
          <li>Environmental</li>
          <li>Health</li>
          <li>Wildlife Conservation</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p className="body">
        <h2>Agriculture</h2>
        You might be working on a rural farm helping out or educating people on
        how important farming is. Education outreach may include demonstrations
        of the process of certain jobs on a farm or workshops in schools.
      </p>
      <p className="body">
        <h2>Children and Youth</h2>
        This entails working with kids in either schools, nurseries, sports
        activities, summer camps or orphanages. The most important aspect of
        dealing with children other than socializing is education and engaging
        alternatives to the temptations of drugs and gangs.
      </p>
      <p className="body">
        <h2>Community Development</h2>
        This category encapsulates a lot of different things. Helping the
        homeless or installing solar panels at a health clinic or water
        catchment systems at a school and training firefighters in emergency
        response to supporting the administration of microcredit programs.
      </p>
      <p className="body">
        <h2>Disaster Relief</h2>
        This can be a tough job but a necessary one. Disaster strikes without
        warning and violently that can cause a lot of destruction and death.
        This job requires physical and mental strength to deal with debry and
        rebuilding as well as dealing with the shock of seeing such destruction.
        There are many ways to volunteer and if you aren't physically capable of
        traveling donating water, food, and supplies is more helpful than you
        think.
      </p>
      <p className="body">
        <h2>Education</h2>
        Educational volunteering work is very fulfilling. Teaching people can
        help them understand a subject but also fortifies your knowledge of that
        subject as well. It's a win win situation that can include tutoring,
        teaching at schools, teaching english to non english speakers to help
        them acclimate to their new environment and much more.
      </p>
      <p className="body">
        <h2>Environmental</h2>
        There is a whole host of things you can do for the environment like
        beach cleaning, park cleaning, planting trees, cleaning the ocean and
        one thing that most people skip is education. Educating people on how to
        reduce our carbon footprint can arguably be the most effective way in
        keeping our earth clean and healthy. With education, in a perfect world,
        there would be no cleaning in the first place.
      </p>
      <p className="body">
        <h2>Health</h2>
        You may think that volunteering in a hospital is almost impossible
        because you don't know anything about the human body but there are other
        ways to help. Other than a volunteer nurse hospitals can use
        receptionists, keeping track of inventory, socializing with patients and
        a favorite of everyone including staff and patients, bringing a therapy
        dog.
      </p>
      <p className="body">
        <h2>Wildlife Conservation</h2>
        Wildlife conservation is among the most grueling in terms of dealing
        with saving animals lives. It can be physically demanding and
        emotionally draining. Volunteering here can include stopping poachers,
        exotic animal traffickers, researching by catch and release, or insuring
        the safety of newly hatched baby turtles from nest to ocean.
