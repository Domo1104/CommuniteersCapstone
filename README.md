<h2>Overview</h2>
This webpage was intended to give the user an easy and simple experience in looking for volunteering opportunities. First log in and if you haven't you must sign up. Second you can view all the events available and search within those events. Once you've spotted an event that interests you, click on the event for more options. You will be able to choose the desired task/role that you will participate in and click join event. That event is now saved in your "volunteer" page and you can keep track of past and present events. Editing the role is easy if you change your mind, simply click on the edit task button and choose a new task then submit. Deleting an event if your schedule has changed is even easier with a single click of the delete button.

<h2>Languages used</h2>
This project has been made with React as the front end and Rails on the backend. The front end is simple to navigate and without clutter. The backend has all the necessary CRUD and auth and React saves the log in information.
